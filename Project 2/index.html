            <h2>Measuring Tips</h2>
            <P>You will need several items in order to measure.</P>
            <li>Metal tape measure</li>
            <li>pencil</li>
            <li>paper</li>
            <p>After organizing your supplies you will need to measure the depth inside the window. This will determine whether you can mount
                the blind or shade inside the window frame or outside of the window frame.  Most blinds and shades currently 
                require a minimum of 1/2 inch to mount it inside.  The shade will not be flush mounted but you can mount 
                it.  Others require a larger depth so it depends on the window treatment that you choose.   Once you have the 
                depth it will be easy to know if you need to measure for an "inside" or "outside" mount. </p>

            <p><b>INSIDE MOUNTS</b> - For window treatments mounted inside the window frame, measure from side to side to side inside the window frame. 
                Take three <i>width</i> measurements - top, middle and bottom. Your width will always be the smallest of the three measurements to 
                the nearest 1/8 inch.  Measure the <i>length</i> at the left, center and right sides of the window inside the frame.  Use the 
                longest of these measurements.</p>

            <p><b>OUTSIDE MOUNTS</b> -'To mount a window treatment outside of the window frame, you need to measure the <i>width</i> from outside edge of 
                molding to outside edge of molding.  The <i>length</i> is measured from the top of the wood molding to the bottom of the wood molding.  
                It is generally recommended to add at least 1/4 inch extra on each side to ensure that the window is covered since not all window 
                frames are square.' </p>
